Bootstrap 5 Starter Template


To use this starter template work on scss, follow this step:

If you're on Windows, you can run the Ruby <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/" target="_blank">Installer</a>. On Linux, Rails Ready provides several Ruby essentials. On OS X, Ruby is already installed by default so Ruby just works.

Install Sass
Open up your Terminal.app and type:

Windows:
<pre>gem install compass</pre>

Linux / OS X:
<pre>sudo gem install compass</pre>

CSS Parser:
<pre>gem install css_parser</pre>


On your project directory run this command and let Compass do its thing:
<pre>compass watch</pre>
or
<pre>compass compile</pre>
